  Guide to publishing plans in Kinde with Stripe synchronization and testing best practices.
---

When you publish a plan, all of the plan features and charges are synced to Stripe where they are transformed into products that users can buy. 

We recommend testing, reviewing, and making all changes before publishing plans. 

When you are ready, open the plan and select **Publish plan** in the top right of the plan window. Do this for each plan you want users to subscribe to.
