You can invite other team members and give them access to your business on Kinde.

## Member roles

We’ve kept roles simple. There’s really only two for now:

**Owner** - The person who creates the business in Kinde is automatically the Owner. They have the highest access level in the Kinde business. Only an owner can approve data export from Kinde.

**Admin** - All other team members in Kinde are created as Admins. They have access to all Kinde features, except data export approval.

## Add a new member**

Owners and Admins can add other Admins.

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left, and then select **Business settings**. 
2. Select **Members** in the side menu.
3. Select **Add member**.
4. In the window that appears, enter the team member’s details.
5. Select **Save**. Your team member will receive an email with an invitation to join your business on Kinde. They can set up an account or sign in to an existing account.

## Promote a team member to an Owner

To promote someone to an Owner role in your business, you will need to contact support@kinde.com (from an Owner email) and request that the new team member be promoted to the role of Owner.

## **Revoke an invitation**

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left, and then select **Business settings**. 
2. Select **Members** in the side menu.
3. Find the team member in the list, they will have a tage showing 'invited' next to their name. 
4. Select the three dots, then select **Revoke invitation**.

## Delete **team member**

Owners and Admins can delete other Admins. Only Kinde can delete Owners, and only on request and verification.

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left and then select **Business settings**. 
2. Select **Members** in the side menu.
3. Find the team member in the list, select the three dots, then select **Delete team member**.
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
