  Guide to setting billing policies for plan changes including usage billing and refund policies.
---

If you offer different levels of paid plans, then you will need to facilitate plan upgrade or downgrade. Before you make plan changes, make sure you have set the policies. 

## Set billing policies for cancellation and plan changes

You can also set policies to control what happens when a customer cancels or changes their plan. The policies are for deciding if you charge or forgive unpaid usage of metered features, and if you refund or retain unused, paid subscription days. 

By default, unpaid usage is forgiven and you don't refund or credit for unused subscription days.

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Billing** to set these policy defaults.
2. In the **Policies** section, choose the settings.

3. Select **Save**.
