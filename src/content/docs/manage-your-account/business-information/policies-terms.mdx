When your users sign up or sign in to your business via the Kinde platform, they implicitly agree to your Privacy policy and Terms of use (or licence terms).

You can add and update these so they apply across your business.

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Business > Details**.
2. Scroll to the **Terms of use and privacy** section.
3. Enter the relevant URLs for each policy and select **Save**.
