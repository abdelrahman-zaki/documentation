If you want, you can select different authentication methods for different applications. You might want to do this, for example, so users sign in with Google for your Android app and Apple for your iOS app.

You first need to [set up all your auth methods](/authenticate/authentication-methods/set-up-user-authentication/) and [set up each application](/build/applications/add-and-manage-applications/).

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Applications**.
2. Select **View details** on the application you want to edit.
3. In the **Application details** screen, select **Authentication** in the left menu.
4. Use the toggle switches to change the authentication methods for the app.
5. If there is a method that you want that is not listed, [set it up](/authenticate/authentication-methods/set-up-user-authentication/).
6. When you’re finished, select **Save**.
7. Repeat for each application.
