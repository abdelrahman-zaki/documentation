This is an advanced feature that is only available on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/)

If you want, you can set a unique email address and sender name for each organization you have. Users in the organization will receive emails from the email address and sender name you set, for example one-time passcode emails.

You can change the customer sender name any time, but you must have a [custom email sender](/get-started/connect/customize-email-sender/) set up to change the email sender address. 

## Change the email sender name for an organization

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**, then view an organization.
2. Select **Email**.
3. Add or change the **Sender name**.
4. Select **Save**.
5. To change the sender email, see below.
