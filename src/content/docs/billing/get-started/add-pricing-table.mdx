  Guide to creating pricing tables for plan selection in registration flows and self-serve portal.
---

Kinde lets you create pricing tables based on your plans. The tables can be integrated into the auth flow so that plan selection becomes part of registration. It might look something like this.

![pricing table example](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/8514b968-262d-4aec-24bd-02070669e300/public)

Pricing tables are also used in the plan upgrade and downgrade flows available in the self-serve portal. So when a customer changes their plan, the pricing table appears for them to select the new plan option.

To create your own, go to [Build a pricing table](/billing/billing-user-experience/plan-selection/).

If you have your own screen flows for plan display and selection, you do not have to use Kindeâ€™s pricing tables.
