To support the delivery of our services, Kinde may engage and use data processors (“sub-processor“) with possible access to external user personal information that is uploaded, accessed, processed, or transmitted to and from our services. This page provides important information about the identity, role, and location of each sub-processor.

If you have signed a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Kinde, we will notify you of any changes to sub-processors. If you need a DPA, please reach out to our team at support@kinde.com.

Last update to the sub-processors for the external users is August 11, 2025.

## Sub-Processors for external users - Authentication

External users are customers of Kinde’s customers.

Kinde will share external user personal information to the following third parties to facilitate authentication and customer support. For public cloud hosting and webhooks, the location is directly aligned only with the customer’s selected Kinde region.

Email services: If you are using your own custom SMTP provider to send emails via Kinde, AWS for email services is not a sub-processor.

Customer support: We do not recommend sending external user personal information, such as their email, in our support conversations, however we acknowledge that this may happen. All customer support tools, whether you interact with them or not, and their location of processing are listed.
