  Guide to creating and managing plan groups in Kinde for B2B/B2C organization and pricing table display.
---

Plan groups are a way of organizing sets of related plans together. 

A plan group can be defined as an 'organization' or 'user' type, depending who you are selling to. For (B2B) businesses, use the organization type. For (B2C) individual customers, use the 'user' type. If you are a B2B2C business, create one group of each type. 

How you set up plans in the group impacts how you present feature bundles on a pricing table.

## Default plan groups

When you first add a plan in Kinde, you select the plan type and a plan group will be automatically created for you. You can later change the name of the group, or make a different group the default group. There can only be one default group for organizations and one for users. The default group is what is displayed by default on a pricing table.

## Add a plan group

1. Go to **Billing > Plans**.
2. Select **Add group**.
3. Enter a **Name** and select the type of plan the group contains.
4. Choose a colour. This only applies to how the group appears on the **Plans** page.
5. Select **Save**.
6. Repeat for all the groups you want to add. 

## Organize plans within a group

The order of plans within a group represents the order they are shown in the Kinde Admin. This does not impact the order they are shown on the pricing table. 

To move a plan up or down in a group, select the three dots menu and select a moving option:

## Delete a plan group

<Aside type="warning">

If you delete a plan group that is associated with a pricing table, the pricing table will also be deleted. These actions are not reversible.

</Aside>

1. Go to **Billing > Plans**.
2. Select the three dots menu near the plan group name.

3. Select **Delete**.
4. In the confirmation window that appears, confirm you want to delete.
