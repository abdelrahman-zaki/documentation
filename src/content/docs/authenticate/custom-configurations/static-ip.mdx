<Aside type="upgrade">

Only businesses on the [Kinde Enterprise plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/) can enable a static IP address for their Kinde business. Additional fees apply.

</Aside>

For companies who work in highly regulated industries such as government, financial services, or education, it is a common requirement to maintain strict 'whitelists' for accessing the internet. For customers with these requirements, Kinde can provide static IP addresses.

## Dynamic IPs are used by default

Kinde uses AWS public cloud to host our services. We make use of AWS's highly scalable infrastructure to ensure the best availability and performance. This infrastructure design means that your Kinde business is assigned a DNS address created during onboarding, which will have a dynamic IP address managed by AWS. You then whitelist the Kinde business domain or your custom domain, to ensure that your customers can access authentication to your product.

## Request a static IP address

For Kinde enterprise customers who have strict IP-based whitelists, Kinde can provide a pair of static IP addresses. We use AWS's Global Accellerator to provision 2 IP addresses assigned to your Kinde business and custom domain, which will ensure that the IP addresses are always the same.

Please reach out to our team at support@kinde.com to discuss your requirements.
