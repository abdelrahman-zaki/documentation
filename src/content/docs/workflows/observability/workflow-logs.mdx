Logs are an important component of a developer's toolkit to troubleshoot and diagnose workflow issues, and to maintain system health. Kinde offers a range of logs to help diagnose issues.

## Sync logs

Sync logs are generated when you sync your code to Kinde. They provide information about the sync process, including any errors or warnings that occurred during the sync.

[See more about sync logs](/workflows/observability/workflow-sync-logs/)

## Build logs

Build logs are generated when you sync your code to Kinde. They provide information about the build process, including any errors or warnings that occurred during the build.

## Runtime logs

Runtime logs are generated when your workflow is executed. They provide information about the execution of your workflow, including any errors or warnings that occurred during the execution.
