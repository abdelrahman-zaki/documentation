  Guide to setting the default billing currency for all Kinde plans with important currency selection considerations.
---

You need to set a default billing currency for all your Kinde plans, before you create them. This is the currency that purchase transactions will be processed in Stripe.

The currency you select cannot be changed after your first plan is published. For now, the default billing currency will be used in all plans and plan groups you create. 

<Aside>

If you have already created a plan and assigned a default currency that way, you may not need to change anything here.

</Aside>

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Billing**.
2. Select a default currency.
3. Select **Save**.
