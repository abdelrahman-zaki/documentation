Follow the procedure below to disconnect the workflow git repo connection. You need to do this in GitHub while we work on making this possible in Kinde.

## Disconnect Git repo for workflows

1. Sign in to GitHub.
2. Go to https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations.
3. Select **Revoke** next to the repo connected to Kinde.
4. Confirm that you want to revoke access. The repo will be disconnected from Kinde.
