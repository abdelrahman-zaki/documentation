You can invite other team members and give them access to your business on Kinde. When you add new people, you can [add a role](/get-started/team-and-account/team-member-roles/) for them as well.

Paid plans come with [multiple pre-defined roles](/get-started/team-and-account/team-member-roles/). Free accounts come with an Owner and Admin role only.

## How team member roles work

- Team members can have any mix of roles, such as Customer success / Engineer / Finance / Marketing / Security specialist. Although it may be easier to give admin rights if broad access is needed.
- Only Owners can promote other team members to Owners
- Any combo of roles can be assigned to team members when they are invited to Kinde
- Roles are gated to prevent being changed by users without sufficient permissions. i.e a read-only person can’t make someone an Owner

## Add a new member

You need sufficient permissions to be able to add team members. 

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left, and then select **Team members**. A list of your current team is shown.
2. Select **Add member**.
3. In the window that appears, enter the team member’s details.
4. Select the roles they will have in the business. This can be more than one.
5. Select **Save**. Your team member will receive an email with an invitation to join your business on Kinde. They can set up an account or sign in to an existing account.

## Change the role of a team member

You need sufficient permissions to be able to change member roles. An owner can make any changes. An Admin can make any changes (except to the Owner role).

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left, and then select **Team members**. A list of your current team is shown.
2. Select the three dots next to the team member who's role you want to change.
3. In the menu that appears, select **Edit roles**.
4. Using the toggles, change the roles they will have in the business. This can be more than one. Note you are restricted by your own role as to your ability to change roles for others.
5. Select **Save**. The team member's roles have been changed.

## **Revoke an invitation**

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left, and then select **Business settings**. 
2. Select **Members** in the side menu.
3. Find the team member in the list, they will have a tage showing 'invited' next to their name. 
4. Select the three dots, then select **Revoke invitation**.

## Delete **team member**

Owners and Admins can delete other Admins. Only Kinde can delete Owners, and only on request and verification.

1. On the Kinde home page, select the avatar menu on the bottom left and then select **Business settings**. 
2. Select **Members** in the side menu.
3. Find the team member in the list, select the three dots, then select **Delete team member**.
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
