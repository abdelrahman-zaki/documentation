<Aside type="upgrade">

Only businesses on the [Kinde Enterprise plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/) can enable a static IP address for their Kinde business. Additional fees apply.

</Aside>

A common enterprise requirement, especially for companies who work in highly regulated industries such as government, financial services, or education, is to maintain strict whitelists for when accessing the internet. For customers who have customers with strict whitelisting requirements, we can offer static IP addresses for your Kinde business.

## How it works now

Kinde uses AWS public cloud to host it's services. We make use of AWS's highly scalable infrastructure to ensure the best availability and performance that we can offer. Part of this infrastructure design means that your Kinde business would be assigned a DNS address created by you during onboarding, which will have a dynamic IP address managed by AWS. Customers can whitelist the Kinde business address, or your custom domain if setup, to ensure that they can access the Kinde authentication to your product. 

## Static IP address

For customers who have strict whitelists that are IP based, Kinde can offer a pair of static IP addresses for your Kinde business. Note that this feature is only available to customers on our Kinde's Enterprise plan. We utilise AWS's Global Accellerator to provision 2 IP addresses assigned to your Kinde business and custom domain, which will ensure that the IP addresses are predictable. 

## How to enable
