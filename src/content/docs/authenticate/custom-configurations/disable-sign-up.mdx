  Complete guide to disabling self sign-up for businesses and organizations, enabling invitation-only user management.
---

You can prevent users from signing up to your business, and only add users selectively.

You might do this if you only want to give access to employees or members.

Disabling sign-ups applies across an environment. Depending on your Kinde plan, you may can also [manage sign-ups per organization](/build/organizations/allow-user-signup-org/).

## Disable self sign-up for your business

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Policies**.
2. Switch off the **Allow self-sign up** option.

You can then [import users](/manage-users/add-and-edit/import-users-in-bulk/), [add them manually](/manage-users/add-and-edit/add-and-edit-users/), or add them [via the Kinde API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/users/post/api/v1/user).

## Disable self sign-up to an organization

You can disable self sign-up per organization.

However, if you allow self sign-up in your business (and have not disabled it as per the above procedure), at least one organization must allow sign-ups.

1. Go to **Organizations**.
2. Select the organization you want to disable sign-ups for.
3. Go to **Policies**.
4. Switch off the **Allow org members to be auto-added** option.
5. Select **Save**.
