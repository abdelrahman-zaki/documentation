In Kinde, properties are organized into categories so they can be more easily managed and displayed. A property category either applies to user, organization, or application data.

You can also create and manage property categories through the [Kinde Management API](/kinde-apis/management#tag/property-categories).

## Add a property category

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** **> Data management > Properties**.
2. Select **Categories**. A page opens showing the different categories for each property type: User, organization, or application.
3. Select **Add Category**. The **Add category** window opens.
4. Enter a name for the category. Remember this becomes a heading on the user, organization, or application properties page.
5. Select if the category is for users, organizations, or applications.
6. Select **Save**.

Hereâ€™s an example:
