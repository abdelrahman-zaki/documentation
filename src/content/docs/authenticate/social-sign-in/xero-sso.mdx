  Complete guide to setting up Xero social sign-in with app creation, OAuth configuration, and Kinde integration.
---

You can enable users to sign up and sign in using their Xero credentials. To enable this, you’ll need a Xero app and some developer know-how.

<Aside type="warning" title="Social sign in for production environments">

Before you make your production environment live, you must add your own social app's Client ID and Client secret in the Kinde connection (as per below). Do not use Kinde's app credentials by leaving the fields blank, as this poses a security and performance risk, and makes it difficult to change auth providers without service disruptions for your users.

</Aside>

## **Get your Kinde callback URL**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. In the **Social connections** section, select **Add connection.**
3. In the window that appears, select **Xero,** then select **Next**. 
4. In the **Callback URL** section:
   1. If you use Kinde’s domain as your default, copy the **Kinde domain** URL.
   2. If you use custom domains, select the **Use custom domain instead** switch. 
   3. If you have only one custom domain, copy the **Custom domain** URL. If you have custom domains for multiple organizations, select each one from the list and copy the callbacks for each. You need to enter all custom domain callbacks in the Xero app.
5. Select **Save**.
6. Use the copied Callback URLs to set up the app, see below.

## **Create and configure a Xero app**

1. Create a Xero developer account. [https://developer.xero.com/](https://developer.xero.com/)
2. Verify your email when prompted.
3. Select New app.
4. Give the app a name and select Web app as the type.
5. Add your company URL.
6. Enter your Kinde callback URL in the **Redirect URI** field. Add additional entries for all your organization custom domain callbacks, e.g. `account.customdomainone.com/login/callback`, `account.customdomaintwo.com/login/callback`, etc.
7. Accept the terms and conditions and select **Create App**.
8. Go to **Configuration** and copy the **Client id** somewhere you can access it later.
9. Generate a **Client secret** and copy it immediately somewhere you can access it again. You will not get to copy it again.

## **Add Xero credentials to Kinde**

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings** > **Authentication**.
2. On the **Xero** tile, select **Configure**.
3. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the Xero app into the relevant fields.
4. Select if you want to treat this connection as a trusted provider. A [trusted provider](/authenticate/about-auth/identity-and-verification/) is one that guarantees the email they issue is verified. We recommend leaving this off for maximum security.
5. Add any [upstream params](/authenticate/auth-guides/pass-params-idp/) that you want to pass to the IdP.
6. Select which applications will allow Xero social sign in.
7. Select **Save**.

Users will now see Xero as an option to sign up and sign in to the selected applications.
