If youâ€™ve received a Kinde perk code from a Kinde Community Partner, send us the code, along with details of who you got it from so we can credit your account. 

Email us at support@kinde.com with the subject 'Claiming Kinde perk credit'

Once we verify the code, we will apply credits to your account. Expect the credit to be deducted from your normal billing until the credit runs out.
