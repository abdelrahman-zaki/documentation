  Guide to developing a plan strategy and building plans in Kinde including B2B/B2C considerations and feature planning.
---

Whether you currently charge for services or are just starting out, building plans is the more complex part of the billing setup process. We recommend you define a strategy before adding plans in Kinde.

- [Learn more about how plans work in Kinde](/billing/manage-plans/about-plans/)
- [Skip to creating plans](/billing/manage-plans/create-plans)

## Develop a plan strategy

If you have not created plans before, here’s a list of tasks to help you prepare. These will give you a strategy for creating the plans you need in Kinde.

1. Are you creating B2B or B2C or B2B2C plans? B2B plan types are for business customers (organizations), B2C plan types are for individual users, B2B2C is a platform model, where you have a customer who is an organization, and then users who are customers of that organization. 
2. Decide how many plans you want and the name of each plan. E.g. `Free, Pro, Plus` or `Solo, Team, Enterprise`.
3. Make a list of each [plan’s features](/billing/manage-plans/create-plans). For each feature, decide on:
    - the [pricing model](/billing/pricing/pricing-models/) that applies
    - limits and inclusions for a feature
    
    Anything you ‘gate’ access to, or put limits on in your product, should be on this list.
    
    Tip: Create a spreadsheet to keep track of everything.

    ![example spreadsheet for plan planning](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/401ff633-c6c8-45ba-9502-1a29274b4400/public)
    
4. Identify which features are common across plans. You don’t need to add a new feature every time, you can [re-use features](/billing/manage-plans/about-plans/) across plans and change the details.

**See [Create plans](/billing/manage-plans/create-plans)** for step-by-step instructions.
