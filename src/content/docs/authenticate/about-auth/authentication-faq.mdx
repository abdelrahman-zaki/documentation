## About Authentication

<details>
<summary>Why does authentication fail even when the correct credentials are entered?</summary>

Authentication failures can occur due to several reasons. Here's what to check first:

- Check if your application's authentication settings are properly configured in the Kinde dashboard. 
- Verify that the correct authentication methods are enabled for your application. 
- If you're using social sign-in, ensure your third-party credentials are correctly configured. 
- For enterprise connections, check that your SAML certificates haven't expired. 
- Review authentication logs to identify specific error patterns.
- If you are using an SDK and just setting up auth, make sure your env variables are set correctly.

</details>

<details>
<summary>My users are getting locked out of their accounts - what's causing this?</summary>

Account lockouts typically happen due to multiple failed authentication attempts or security policies. Kinde implements rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks. Users may be temporarily locked out after several consecutive failed login attempts. The lockout duration varies based on your security settings. To resolve this, users can wait for the lockout period to expire or you can manually reset their authentication status. For enterprise users, check if your organization's security policies are causing the lockouts. Learn more about [managing authentication applications](/authenticate/manage-authentication/manage-authentication-applications/) and [access control settings](/manage-users/access-control/delete-or-suspend-users/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long do authenticated sessions last before users need to sign in again?</summary>

Session duration depends on your application's security settings and the authentication method used. By default, Kinde sessions last for 24 hours, but this can be customized by [configuring token and session expiry](https://docs.kinde.com/build/tokens/configure-tokens/). 

Enterprise connections may have different [session policies](https://docs.kinde.com/authenticate/manage-authentication/session-management/) based on your organization's requirements. 

Users can also be logged out automatically after periods of inactivity. For more sensitive applications, consider implementing shorter session durations or additional security measures like [multi-factor authentication](https://www.notion.so/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/enable-multi-factor-authentication/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I make it so that users are signed out when they close the browser session?</summary>

Yes, you can achieve this by setting sessions cookies to be [non-persistent](https://docs.kinde.com/authenticate/manage-authentication/session-management/) via policies. You can apply this for everyone, or to [apply in specific organizations](https://docs.kinde.com/authenticate/manage-authentication/session-management-per-organization/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can users access my app from multiple devices at the same time?</summary>

Yes, users can typically access your application from multiple devices simultaneously. Each device will maintain its own authentication session. However, some enterprise configurations may restrict concurrent sessions based on your organization's security policies. If you want to limit concurrent sessions, you can configure this in your authentication settings. Users can also manually log out from specific devices through their account settings. Learn more about [managing user sessions](/authenticate/manage-authentication/user-auth-applications/) and [organization authentication settings](/authenticate/manage-authentication/organization-auth-experience/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if a user tries to log in from a new location or device?</summary>

When users log in from new locations or devices, Kinde may trigger additional security measures depending on your settings. This could include sending verification emails, requiring additional authentication steps, or prompting for multi-factor authentication. Enterprise connections may have specific policies for new device authentication. You can configure these security behaviors in your authentication settings. For high-security applications, consider enabling [multi-factor authentication](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) to add an extra layer of protection.
</details>

## Authentication Methods

<details>
<summary>My users keep forgetting their passwords - what are my options?</summary>

You have several options to help users who forget their passwords. Kinde provides built-in password reset functionality that sends secure reset links via email. You can also enable [passwordless authentication](/authenticate/authentication-methods/passwordless-authentication/) which eliminates the need for passwords entirely. Another option is to implement [phone authentication](/authenticate/authentication-methods/phone-authentication/) as an alternative login method. For enterprise users, you can integrate with your existing password management systems through [SAML connections](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/custom-saml/). Consider offering multiple authentication methods to improve user experience.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are authentication emails not reaching my users' inboxes?</summary>

Email delivery issues can occur due to several factors. Check your [email deliverability settings](/authenticate/authentication-methods/email-deliverability/) to ensure proper configuration. Verify that your domain's SPF and DKIM records are correctly set up. Authentication emails might be going to spam folders - ask users to check their spam/junk folders. You can also customize the sender email address and branding to improve deliverability. For enterprise setups, ensure your email provider allows authentication emails from Kinde's servers. Consider implementing [phone authentication](/authenticate/authentication-methods/phone-authentication/) as a backup option.
</details>

<details>
<summary>My users are getting "invalid password" errors even with correct passwords - what's wrong?</summary>

This issue often occurs when there are problems with password hashing or storage. Kinde uses secure hashing algorithms, but configuration issues can cause authentication failures. Check if your application is properly configured for [password authentication](/authenticate/authentication-methods/password-authentication/). Verify that your authentication settings match between development and production environments. If users recently changed their passwords, ensure they're using the new password. You can also check authentication logs for specific error messages. Consider implementing [passwordless authentication](/authenticate/authentication-methods/passwordless-authentication/) to avoid password-related issues entirely.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can users change their authentication method after they've already signed up?</summary>

Yes, users can typically change their authentication method after signing up, but this depends on your application's configuration. Users can add additional authentication methods like social sign-in or phone authentication to their existing accounts. However, changing from password-based to passwordless authentication may require re-authentication. You can configure which authentication methods users can add or modify through your application settings. Learn more about [managing user authentication](/authenticate/manage-authentication/user-auth-applications/) and [customizing the authentication experience](/authenticate/custom-configurations/authentication-experience/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why is phone authentication taking so long to send verification codes?</summary>

Phone authentication delays can occur due to carrier issues, network congestion, or SMS gateway limitations. Check your [phone authentication configuration](/authenticate/authentication-methods/phone-authentication/) to ensure proper setup. Some phone numbers may have restrictions that prevent SMS delivery. International numbers may experience longer delays. You can configure fallback options like email verification for cases where SMS delivery fails. Consider implementing [multi-factor authentication](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) with multiple verification methods to improve reliability.
</details>

## Social Sign-In

<details>
<summary>My users are getting "access denied" errors when trying to sign in with Google - why?</summary>

Google sign-in "access denied" errors typically occur due to configuration issues. Check that your Google OAuth credentials are correctly configured in both Google Console and Kinde. Verify that your redirect URIs match exactly between the two platforms. Ensure your Google app is properly configured for the correct environment (development vs production). The error may also occur if users haven't granted the necessary permissions to your application. Learn more about [configuring Google sign-in](/authenticate/social-sign-in/google/) and [adding social sign-in](/authenticate/social-sign-in/add-social-sign-in/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are some social sign-in buttons not working on mobile devices?</summary>

Mobile-specific issues with social sign-in can occur due to browser compatibility, popup blockers, or mobile-specific OAuth configurations. Some social providers require specific mobile app configurations. Check that your social sign-in is properly configured for mobile browsers. Ensure that popup blockers aren't preventing the authentication flow. You may need to configure different settings for mobile vs desktop authentication. Learn more about [mobile authentication configuration](/authenticate/social-sign-in/add-social-sign-in/) and [custom authentication pages](/authenticate/custom-configurations/custom-authentication-pages/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>My users' social accounts are linked to the wrong email addresses - how do I fix this?</summary>

This issue occurs when users have multiple email addresses associated with their social accounts. Users can typically unlink and relink their social accounts through their profile settings. You may need to guide users through the process of updating their email addresses in their social account settings. For enterprise users, you can configure [SAML connections](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/custom-saml/) to ensure consistent email mapping. Learn more about [managing user identities](/manage-users/add-and-edit/add-manage-user-identities/) and [social sign-in configuration](/authenticate/social-sign-in/add-social-sign-in/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are users getting "app not configured" errors with Facebook sign-in?</summary>

Facebook "app not configured" errors occur when your Facebook app settings don't match your Kinde configuration. Check that your Facebook app is properly configured with the correct domain and redirect URIs. Verify that your Facebook app is in the correct mode (development vs live). Ensure that the Facebook app ID and secret are correctly entered in your Kinde dashboard. You may need to configure different settings for web and mobile platforms. Learn more about [Facebook sign-in configuration](/authenticate/social-sign-in/facebook/) and [social sign-in setup](/authenticate/social-sign-in/add-social-sign-in/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>My Apple Sign-In is working on iOS but not on web browsers - what's the issue?</summary>

Apple Sign-In web browser issues often occur due to domain verification problems or incorrect configuration. Apple requires domain verification for web-based sign-in. Check that your domain is properly verified in Apple's developer console. Ensure that your Apple app configuration includes web platform settings. Verify that your redirect URIs are correctly configured for web browsers. You may need different configurations for iOS apps vs web applications. Learn more about [Apple Sign-In configuration](/authenticate/social-sign-in/apple/) and [domain verification requirements](/authenticate/social-sign-in/add-social-sign-in/).
</details>

## Multi-Factor Authentication

<details>
<summary>My users are getting locked out after entering the wrong MFA code - how long does this last?</summary>

MFA lockout duration depends on your security settings and the number of failed attempts. Typically, users are temporarily locked out after 3-5 failed MFA attempts. The lockout period usually lasts 15-30 minutes, but this can be configured. Users can use backup codes to bypass the lockout if they have them configured. For enterprise users, lockout policies may be determined by your organization's security settings. Learn more about [MFA configuration](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) and [managing MFA settings](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/mfa-per-org/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are MFA codes not being sent to my users' phones?</summary>

MFA code delivery issues can occur due to SMS gateway problems, carrier restrictions, or phone number formatting issues. Check that phone numbers are entered in the correct international format. Some carriers may block authentication SMS messages. Users can try using authenticator apps instead of SMS for more reliable delivery. You can also configure email as a backup MFA method. Learn more about [MFA setup](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) and [phone authentication configuration](/authenticate/authentication-methods/phone-authentication/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>My users lost their MFA device - how do they get back into their account?</summary>

Users who lose their MFA device can recover access through several methods. If they have backup codes configured, they can use those to bypass MFA. You can also manually reset MFA for users through your admin dashboard. For enterprise users, you may need to follow your organization's MFA recovery procedures. Consider implementing multiple MFA methods (SMS, email, authenticator apps) to provide backup options. Learn more about [MFA management](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) and [user account recovery](/manage-users/access-control/reset-multi-factor-authentication-for-a-user/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are some users getting "invalid MFA code" errors even with correct codes?</summary>

Invalid MFA code errors can occur due to time synchronization issues between the authenticator app and the server. Check that the user's device time is correctly synchronized. Some authenticator apps may have drifted time settings. Users can try refreshing their authenticator app or regenerating MFA codes. For enterprise setups, ensure that your server time is properly synchronized. Learn more about [MFA troubleshooting](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/enable-multi-factor-authentication/) and [MFA configuration](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/mfa-per-org/).
