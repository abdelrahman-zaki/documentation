You can add and manage Kinde’s feature flags through the Kinde API as well as through the main admin interface.

## What you need

- A machine to machine application set up to [connect to the Kinde Management API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/)
- [A valid access token](/developer-tools/kinde-api/connect-to-kinde-api/)

## Current flag functions in the API

If you plan to use feature flags through the Kinde API, you will be able to do the following:

- Add a new flag
- Edit a flag
- Override a flag value in an environment or organization
- Delete a flag

[See relevant posts and responses in the API documentation.](/kinde-apis/management#tag/feature-flags)
