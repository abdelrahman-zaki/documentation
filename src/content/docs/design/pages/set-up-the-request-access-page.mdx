When you are a brand new company and still building your application, you might want new users to request access to your product.

People who customize pages also like to [use their own domain instead of Kinde’s](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/).

## **Design and activate the request access page**

1. Go to **Design > Lead generation > Request access**.
2. Make your design and layout selections. For tips on how to change things, see [Design your welcome pages](/design/brand/global-brand-defaults/).
3. Enter the **Success link URL**.
4. Select **Preview** to view how the page will look.
5. Once you like it, switch the **Page details** button to **Live** and then select **Save**.
6. To change the content on the page, go to **Page content** in the menu, and select the **Request access** page. 
7. Make the changes you want in all the relevant languages and **Save**.
8. You'll need to separately set up the **Request Access URL** on your website.

## Manage request access contacts

As you collect contacts who want access to your product, you can manage them in the [Access requests list](/build/set-up-options/manage-access-requests/) in Kinde. You can also easily convert these contacts to users.
