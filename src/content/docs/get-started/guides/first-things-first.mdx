First, [sign up for a business and get a Kinde domain](https://app.kinde.com/register).

## Choose your own business adventure

When you sign up for a new business, you’ll be guided through a few decisions about how you want to set up your business, including the tech stack you use, the social authentication methods you want, and whether you are bringing your own code, or are starting from scratch.

Then you’ll be asked if you want to use the Quick Start method to get your app connected.

![quickstart example](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/52d876f0-afc1-4f56-0c05-992c7f7a2800/public)

## Take the Quick Start path

Follow our **Quick Start** guide to get connected fast.

You can jump straight in there from the onboarding, or you might have breezed through these steps so you can look around. Either way, here’s how to find your way back.

1. On the Kinde home page, select **View details** on your app tile.
2. Select **Quick start** in the menu.
3. Select the relevant tab: **Starter kit** or **Existing codebase.**

  ![Tab selection options](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/31311feb-d809-4d04-ab91-6986f4b1b000/public)

4. Follow the steps to get connected!

If you need to, you can also change the technology you selected.

<Aside>

You can access the **Quick start** guide for any of your applications. Go to **Settings** > **Applications** > **View details** (on the application tile) > **Quick start.**
