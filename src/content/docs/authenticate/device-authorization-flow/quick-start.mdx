The Device authorization Flow allows users to authenticate on one device (like a TV or smart device) using another device (like a phone or computer). This is perfect for devices with limited input capabilities.

In this quick start, you'll learn how to implement the Device Authorization Flow using Kinde in just 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- `curl` or a similar HTTP client

## Step 1 - Create a Device Authorization app

1. From the home page select **Add application**
2. Enter a name
3. Choose **Device and IoT**
4. Select **Save**
5. Make a note of the Client ID, you'll need this later

## Step 2 - Enable an authentication method for your application

1. Select **Authentication** from the left hand menu
2. Select **Configure** on the **Passwordless** > **Email + code** card
3. Under **Applications** select the application you created in step 1
4. Select **Save**

## Step 3 - Request a device code

Request a device code from Kinde's authorization endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-subdomain>.kinde.com/oauth2/device/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" \
  -d "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code"
```

The response will include a `device_code`, `user_code`, and `verification_uri`:

```json
{
  "device_code": "kinde_dc_...",
  "user_code": "CSLDFDUU",
  "verification_uri": "https://<your-subdomain>.kinde.com/device",
  "verification_uri_complete": "https://<your-subdomain>.kinde.com/device?user_code=CSLDFDUU",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "interval": 5,
  "qr_code": "data:image/png;base64,..."
}
```

## Step 4 - Display the user code

Show the `user_code` to the user and provide the `verification_uri_complete` or QR code from the response. The user should:

1. Visit the `verification_uri_complete` URL on their phone or computer
2. Complete the authentication process

## Step 5 - Poll for the access token

While the user is authenticating, poll the token endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-subdomain>.kinde.com/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code" \
  -d "client_id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" \
  -d "device_code=<YOUR_DEVICE_CODE>"
```

Continue polling every 5 seconds (or the `interval` value from the response) until you receive a successful response like:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "scope": "",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

## Step 6 - Use the access token

Once you have received the access token, you can call your protected APIs:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-api.com/protected-resource \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Useful tips

You can set an application to be the default for device flows. This will be the application that is used if no Client ID is specified in the request.

1. Select **Settings** > **Applications**
2. Select the Device Authorization application you want to set as default
3. Select **Set as default**
4. Select **Save**
