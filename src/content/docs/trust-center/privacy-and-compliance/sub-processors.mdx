To support the delivery of our services, Kinde may engage and use data processors (each, a “sub-processor“) with possible access to external user personal information that is uploaded, accessed, processed, or transmitted to and from our services. This page provides important information about the identity, role, and location of each sub-processor.

## Sub-Processors for external users

External users are customers of Kinde’s customers.

Notifications of changes to sub-processors for external users will be provided to customers who have signed a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). If you need a DPA, please reach out to our team at support@kinde.com.

Last update to the sub-processors for the external users is July 7, 2025.

### Sub-Processors - Authentication

Kinde will share external user personal information to the following third parties to facilitate authentication and customer support. For public cloud hosting and webhooks, the location is directly aligned with the customer’s selected Kinde region.

We do not recommend sending external user personal information, such as their email, in our support conversations, however we acknowledge that this may happen. All customer support tools, whether you interact with them or not, and their location of processing are listed.
