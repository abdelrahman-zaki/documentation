<Aside type="upgrade">

Only businesses on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/) can enable advanced organization features. Additional fees apply.

</Aside>

When you enable advanced organizations features, you can access extended features for individual organizations. Customizations include:

- Additional access control via [policies](/build/organizations/organization-access-policies/)
- Select [default roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/default-user-roles/#enable-default-roles-in-an-organization) for users who join an organization
- Set [custom email sender details](/build/organizations/email-sender-organization/), so users in specific orgs receive OTP and other emails from the custom address (requires own SMTP)
- Organization-level [custom domains](/build/domains/organization-custom-domain/)
- Organization-level [multi-factor authentication](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/mfa-per-org/)

Read our blog about why you might need [advanced organizations in Kinde](https://kinde.com/blog/authentication/advanced-organizations/).

## Enable advanced organization features

<Aside type="warning">

Note: You can activate advanced features for 5 organizations on the Kinde Scale plan. After that, there is a monthly cost for each organization that is enabled to use advanced features.

</Aside>

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Search or browse for the organization you want and select the name to show the org details.
3. Select **Authentication**.
4. In the **Activate advanced organization features** box, select **Activate**.

## Disable advanced organization features

<Aside type="warning">

Note that when you disable advanced features, all advanced settings revert to global business settings. This could cause breaking changes in apps that rely on custom authentication for the organization. Your next bill will also be adjusted.

</Aside>

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**.
2. Search or browse for the organization you want and select the name to show the org details.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the **Details** page and select **Remove advanced org features**.
4. In the confirmation window, follow the prompts.
