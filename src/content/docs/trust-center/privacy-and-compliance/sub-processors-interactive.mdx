## About this tool

This interactive tool helps you identify which sub-processors are relevant to your specific Kinde business. The URL can be bookmarked for future reference.

The results are filtered based on:

- **Data Region**: The region where your Kinde instance is hosted
- **Services Used**: Which Kinde services you're actively using
- **Email Provider**: Whether you're using Kinde's default email service or your own [custom SMTP provider](/get-started/connect/customize-email-sender)
- **SMS Provider**: Whether you're using Kinde's default SMS service or your own [custom SMS provider](/authenticate/authentication-methods/phone-authentication/)
